						in Berlin, connecting nightlife connoisseurs, ravers, and lonely hearts to their favorite artists, labels,
						and venues. One experimental festival quickly led to a series of 10 virtual festivals that year, bringing

						attendees new ways to interact online.

						Now in 2022, weâ€™re taking LifeLive to web3. Our vision is to enable a direct connection between artists and
						fans, shaking up the current system controlled by middlemen, and promote a new wave of global talent in
						inclusive nightlife settings. We are setting up a DAO to help progressively decentralize the platform,
						enabling our community to design and manage their own events and to become involved in the evolution of
						LifeLive itself - from rewards structure to feature sets to team hiring.
